# PROG 01: Crunch Time

This is a simple calorie converter. Users can enter their weight, and the amount of reps/minutes of an exercise they did. The calorie converter will show how many calories the users burned with the selected exercise. In addition, the user can see equivalent exercises to burn the same amount of calories. Finally, the user can also simply just enter how many calories they burned, and see how much of each exercise they need to do.
